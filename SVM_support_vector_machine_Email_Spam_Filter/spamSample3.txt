On Monday morning I sent you the top three rated horses from the Monte Carlo Simulator inside the RA Pro Member's Club.

Here's a copy of it.

What happened?

This...

16:20 we found the second place horse at 33/1

16:50 we found the winner at 8/1 and the second place horse at 11/8

17:20 we found the winner at 4/1 and the second place horse at 9/2

17:50 we found the winner at 100/30

18:20 we found the winner at 9/4

18:50 we found the winner at 2/9

19:20 we found the winner at 4/1 and the third place horse at 16/1

That means we found six winners from seven races, three second placers and one third placer.

However you bet on these races, you'd have made a profit. So I hope that you opened your emails on Monday morning ðŸ˜‰

How did I do it?

I used our standard race card in the Monte Carlo Simulator and took the top three horses.

You can get your free trial to the RA Pro Members Club here.

All the best,

P.S. The odds above are to SP, so you'd have got much better results at Betfair SP or BOG.

P.P.S. This is an excellent example of how powerful our Monte Carlo Simulator is, but I recommend that you follow our strategies and training for consistent long-term profit.
